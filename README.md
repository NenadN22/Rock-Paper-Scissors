# Rock-Paper-Scissors

### Notes: 
I only fixed some lint errors, here are some advices for the rest:
* Be careful with indendation
* Try to provide type for buttons as its generally a good practice
* Try to regroup the query together
* Don't hesitate to comment your code
* Try to define a function above the call as it can provide error otherwise

Good job, keep going !!
